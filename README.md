# Portfolio 👀

#### [fabianswe.com](https://www.fabianswe.com)

 My portfolio's front end utilizing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](http://reactjs.org/), and [Apollo](http://apollographql.com/) Client. It makes query calls to my backend [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) API to display information.

## TODO

* Improve project/work navigation speeds.
* Fix height calculations when updating vh.
* Add and Improve Accessibility features.
* Modify for mobile displays. 📱
* Look into SEOs for SPAs 🤓
* Design it with more "fun"! 😄
* Add blog posts section. 📄
* Decrease First Load JS (**252 kB** as of 7.13.2020) 🐌
  * SVGs: Remove, minimize, or host online.
  * Remove some 3rd party components.
    * Manual `react-typical` implementation.
* `<span>` some aos-ed components to not mess with page width. (ex. `StylizedBadge`) 👻
